  # How did the idea come about?
  
This page was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The choice of the theme of the page was made to put into practice my knowledge in:

- Positioning of elements using the 'Display Grid' property
- Carousel of images
- Clip-path
- Animation using '@Keyframes'
- Make the page responsive using 'Media Queries'
